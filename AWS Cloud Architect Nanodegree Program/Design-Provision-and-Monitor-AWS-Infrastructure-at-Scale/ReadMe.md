# Design, Provision and Monitor AWS Infrastructure at Scale

In this project, you will **plan, design, provision, and monitor infrastructure in AWS** using industry-standard and open source tools. You will practice the skills you have learned throughout the course to optimize infrastructure for cost and performance. You will also use Terraform to provision and configure AWS services in a global configuration.
