# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.

Make use of AWS Systems Manager's Session Manager service to access the application server.Remove ssh access from the instance. 

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

No. This will keep access insure but this will keep the traffic between different services in VPC and S3 within AWS network ( probable bandwidth cost saving ). 

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

No, new encryption rules apply to data objects which will be saved after applying encryption.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.

This will reset all the changes we did via cli or console.
