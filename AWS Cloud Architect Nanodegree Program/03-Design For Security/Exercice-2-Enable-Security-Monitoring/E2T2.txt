#Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

Security Hub CIS:
================
[CIS.4.1] Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22
[CIS.2.9] Ensure VPC flow logging is enabled in all VPCs
[CIS.4.2] Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 3389
S3.4 S3 buckets should have server-side encryption enabled

AWS Config Non-Compliant Rules:
===============================
securityhub-encrypted-volumes-98327f39 (EC2 volumes are not encrypted)

Inspector:
=========
- On instance i-0e36ff5e96e257557, TCP port 543 which is associated with 'Kerberos' is reachable from the internet
- On instance i-0e36ff5e96e257557, UDP port 21 which is associated with 'FTP' is reachable from the internet
- On instance i-0e36ff5e96e257557, UDP port 20 which is associated with 'FTP' is reachable from the internet

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

Restrict IP address range for security groups on port 22
Enable VPC flow logging
Encrypt s3 buckets
Encrypt EC2 volumes
Restrict S3 access to https only
